//! # sweeten
//!
//! `sweeten` provides enhanced versions of common [`iced`] widgets with
//! additional functionality for more complex use cases. It aims to maintain
//! the simplicity and elegance of `iced` while offering "sweetened" variants
//! with extended capabilities.
//!
//! ## Widgets
//!
//! The following widgets are available in the [`widget`] module:
//!
//! - [`column`] — Distribute content vertically, with support for drag-and-drop
//!   reordering via [`on_drag`](widget::column::Column::on_drag).
//! - [`mouse_area`] — A container for capturing mouse events where all handlers
//!   receive the cursor position as a [`Point`].
//! - [`pick_list`] — A dropdown list of selectable options, with support for
//!   disabling items.
//! - [`row`] — Distribute content horizontally, with support for drag-and-drop
//!   reordering via [`on_drag`](widget::row::Row::on_drag).
//! - [`text_input`] — A text input field, with support for [`on_focus`] and
//!   [`on_blur`] messages.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Import the widgets you need from `sweeten::widget`:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use sweeten::widget::{column, mouse_area, pick_list, row, text_input};
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The widgets are designed to be drop-in replacements for their `iced`
//! counterparts, with additional methods for the extended functionality.
